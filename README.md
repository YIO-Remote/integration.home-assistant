# Repo is deprecated
This repo is deprecated as efforts are put into Remote Two and its new software. Find more information about it here: www.yio-remote.com The software made for Remote Two, once released, will be available for the DIY YIO Remote.

There won't be any updates to this repo, but it will stay here on GitHub to be forked and used.
